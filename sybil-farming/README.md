A whale pulled a slick move by bridging over 1.5 million $OM from ETH using eight different wallets to game the Mantra airdrop. He even created thousands of addresses, making him eligible for approximately 2,500,000 $OM.

Here is his ETH wallet list:

For the Sybil Slaying Season, I redesigned the explorer to better flag suspicious addresses. You can check out the transaction hash `98FF9283C2C82D62B43F20B00CE89D2F212E839EFD375B48DBB7D52027796652` on the Archive node explorer, since Mantra's official explorer doesn't support all historical transactions. My initial setup an Archive node and tweaking [MANTRA-Chain/explorer](https://github.com/MANTRA-Chain/explorer) for improved performance.

Then, within approximately 45 seconds, wallet `mantra17n7cnwj0aeuvn35dh4h9emhvlnydxa365sa6ts` transferred its funds to wallet `mantra1n4u9s9h3c670s7wsfycf6v7d7f2t55ql9gm3sj`, incurring a gas fee of 1,200,000.

To summarize, he controls three main wallets:  
- `mantra1n4u9s9h3c670s7wsfycf6v7d7f2t55ql9gm3sj`  
- `mantra16l5qsgzjueayxa2z78eee53lv3t0kfy3z68pqc`  
- `mantra13y9an26h6mju0xmthuf7ssd4wyuucg2t86ueju` (the new wallet)

Each transaction from the first wallet incurs a gas fee of 1,200,000; transactions from the second wallet use either 200,000 or 400,000; and the new wallet consistently uses a gas fee of 900,000.


He created numerous wallets to split the funds, using the same gas fee for every transaction. If other wallets are connected to his three main wallets, we can identify this behavior as overlapping activities, excessive address clustering, and mass creation of addresses. To detect this, I developed a script that checks the connections with his main wallets, allowing us to classify these wallets based on those criteria.


I started by checking the outgoing transactions from his two main wallets. When an address is found in the [leaderboard API](https://leaderboard.mantra.zone/api/v1/leaderboard/), I use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to explore the connection graph. This algorithm systematically inspects the blockchain address network level by level. It starts with one or more main addresses, then examines each address’s outgoing transactions to discover new addresses, continuing until no new addresses remain. Key to this approach are data structures like a queue (to store addresses to be processed) and a visited set (to avoid reprocessing the same address).

![BFSalgorithm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff7c9aa1-ada2-45b8-ad08-4aff4a649b7b)

After running the script, I obtained two output files: [address_data.json](./address_data.json) and [address_list.txt](./address_list.txt).

Let me explain the structure of [address_data.json](./address_data.json) . For example, the first element is:

```json
{
  "address": "mantra1kcl8cg47nnwnayttplmdajm0mczl2g7md97a8m",
  "route": [
    "mantra1n4u9s9h3c670s7wsfycf6v7d7f2t55ql9gm3sj",
    "mantra1kcl8cg47nnwnayttplmdajm0mczl2g7md97a8m"
  ],
  "data": {
    "address": "mantra1kcl8cg47nnwnayttplmdajm0mczl2g7md97a8m",
    "totalPoints": 8.8,
    "seasonalPoints": 8.8,
    "primaryPoints": 0,
    "rank": 162603,
    "multiplier": 1
  }
}
```

In this example, the address `mantra1kcl8cg47nnwnayttplmdajm0mczl2g7md97a8m` is identified as a Sybil. Notice the `"route"` field, which shows how this address is connected: funds were sent from `mantra1n4u9s9h3c670s7wsfycf6v7d7f2t55ql9gm3sj` to `mantra1kcl8cg47nnwnayttplmdajm0mczl2g7md97a8m`.

The remaining data objects in the JSON are pulled from [leaderboard.mantra.zone/api/](https://leaderboard.mantra.zone/api/v1/leaderboard/), providing additional context and metrics such as total points, seasonal points, rank, and multipliers.

If you check the [address_data.json](./address_data.json) file, you'll notice that address `mantra1n4u9s9h3c670s7wsfycf6v7d7f2t55ql9gm3sj` has directly sent funds to 14 different wallets. Let's verify this on the explorer.

```json
 {
      "address": "mantra1v9tlsh3a5w8nwyp97dgk4wtwxdfdla07fvrmq8",
      "route": [
        "mantra1n4u9s9h3c670s7wsfycf6v7d7f2t55ql9gm3sj",
        "mantra1vugcz5qy6frsjekyfumjdud0mz74xvtg25d7mt",
        "mantra1v9tlsh3a5w8nwyp97dgk4wtwxdfdla07fvrmq8"
      ],
      "data": {
        "address": "mantra1v9tlsh3a5w8nwyp97dgk4wtwxdfdla07fvrmq8",
        "totalPoints": 8.8,
        "seasonalPoints": 8.8,
        "primaryPoints": 0,
        "rank": 126303,
        "multiplier": 1
      }
    },
```
This JSON element indicates a three-step route:

1. Wallet `mantra1n4u9s9h3c670s7wsfycf6v7d7f2t55ql9gm3sj` sent funds to wallet `mantra1vugcz5qy6frsjekyfumjdud0mz74xvtg25d7mt`.
2. Wallet `mantra1vugcz5qy6frsjekyfumjdud0mz74xvtg25d7mt` then forwarded funds to wallet `mantra1v9tlsh3a5w8nwyp97dgk4wtwxdfdla07fvrmq8`.

## Let's verify this route on the explorer.

> Another interesting fact is that wallet `mantra1vugcz5qy6frsjekyfumjdud0mz74xvtg25d7mt` did not receive its initial funds from `mantra1n4u9s9h3c670s7wsfycf6v7d7f2t55ql9gm3sj`. Its first deposit was a small amount bridged from ETH, deposited from an exchange, and then, after a few minutes, transferred to the OM Mantra chain. This method appears to be a deliberate tactic to conceal the Sybil activity.

Indeed, many routes can be observed. He created approximately 380 wallets to obscure the flow of funds. Each of these routes, characterized by small transfers between multiple wallets, contributes to a complex web of overlapping transactions, address clustering, and mass wallet creation. Let's explore it , 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5393df5f-2169-49b2-8d0f-0a8ceb1a1d95)

At 2/4/2025, 4:39:42 PM, wallet `mantra1qrj94z6yytuuygn2pckshjfszdh9qc7nz444fa` received funds from wallet `mantra16l5qsgzjueayxa2z78eee53lv3t0kfy3z68pqc`. Approximately 30 seconds later, it delegated. My explorer doesn't provide detailed information at this page due to limited time to fix it.all remaining funds moved to the next route via wallet `mantra1wx87676trqxx37djpf5tf8sw0nd7g2tce6egls`.

In a similar process, wallet `mantra1qrj94z6yytuuygn2pckshjfszdh9qc7nz444fa` repeated the same steps before moving funds to wallet `mantra1uqtkx3apl3wvaq6ck8mz2rxryzlu7xxge58vrg`.

This process is repeated until the final wallet, `mantra14lac3933r4pzwwvgzuckzd5whe4mrlgfmjrgw5`, is reached.

At this point, it's clear that these transactions are not organic because all transfers occur within seconds and use the same gas fee. I verified 1,760 wallets as Sybil wallets by cross-referencing their transactions with the outgoing addresses of his three main wallets using a BFS algorithm. You can find all the addresses in [address_list.txt](./address_list.txt) and view the routes in [address_data.json](./address_data.json).

## Breadth First Search (BFS) Reverse Algorithm

I analyzed the top 10 wallets from the leaderboard and found that the rank 1 wallet, `mantra1zz23t4kj28zlwlq0z2at0qcztg953lzussc9aw`, sent 95,566 $OM to wallet `mantra1u6vr5lre3ls4apusw2aaevmzchk4yr5g5fg67j` on 2/18/2025.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f305f8a-f833-466a-b4b0-4ec344801e72)

Then, wallet `mantra1u6vr5lre3ls4apusw2aaevmzchk4yr5g5fg67j` transferred all its funds to wallet `mantra13y9an26h6mju0xmthuf7ssd4wyuucg2t86ueju`, which is part of his main wallet.

As mentioned above in [a fact](README.md#lets-verify-this-route-on-the-explorer), the first deposit was a modest amount bridged from ETH, deposited from an exchange. A few minutes later, these funds were transferred to the OM Mantra chain.

Between 1/26/2025 and 1/26/2025, the rank 2 wallet `mantra1wwm5xpejg9kxtmstude76chkd5gzgkeccg5zcz` sent 66,850 OM to `mantra17q5f0g4jlueyv2msg6uhh37f699fwuqr3s2qt4`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1adab48-f958-401c-807b-d6189cb0b053)

Subsequently, wallet `mantra17pw8ard3x9069a3gxhwutc008zg6p6ra53ryqk` transferred all the received funds to the wallet `mantra16l5qsgzjueayxa2z78eee53lv3t0kfy3z68pqc`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b46a7b6e-1e9b-4e33-9321-e350ae073d73)


Between 2/13/2025 and 2/20/2025, the rank 4 wallet `mantra1zw30ps4fnj0mxlta3a0x9x7h2k6egjuc57sz4x` sent 46,887 OM to `mantra17pw8ard3x9069a3gxhwutc008zg6p6ra53ryqk`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0335494-7ff4-4e7a-9553-19540cc38a94)

During the same period, another rank 5 wallet, `mantra1mz36s26p0cx27pxs2sm7je67t06hcyepz76px9`, sent 30,411 OM to the same destination.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f29467b-a879-4c5b-885e-e52222f7f11d)

Subsequently, wallet `mantra17pw8ard3x9069a3gxhwutc008zg6p6ra53ryqk` transferred all the received funds to the wallet `mantra13y9an26h6mju0xmthuf7ssd4wyuucg2t86ueju`

This behavior is clearly abnormal and indicates that the activity is controlled by a single person. To trace all the routes of his wallets, I created a script that checks the connections to his main wallets. I ran this script on his three main wallets—`mantra1n4u9s9h3c670s7wsfycf6v7d7f2t55ql9gm3sj`, `mantra16l5qsgzjueayxa2z78eee53lv3t0kfy3z68pqc`, and `mantra13y9an26h6mju0xmthuf7ssd4wyuucg2t86ueju`—as well as on wallet `mantra1vee03vuqrhsxarlsgnkev22p0xukpeukvp4872` (which is confirmed as one of his wallets; see [here](README.md#the-connection-between-wallet-mantra16l5qsgzjueayxa2z78eee53lv3t0kfy3z68pqc-and-wallet-mantra13y9an26h6mju0xmthuf7ssd4wyuucg2t86ueju-is).


Then, I discovered another 247 addresses. If you want to check the routes, please refer to [address_data_two.json](./address_data_two.json).
