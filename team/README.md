In this **README.md**, I provide a detailed analysis illustrating how funds flow between the team wallets and the Sybil farmer’s wallets, highlighting their interlinked transactions and on-chain evidence.

At a recent announcement  Sybil Detection and Decision on $OM Allocation...

- 123,195 out of 217,351 wallets have been removed from eligibility.  
- As a reward for uncovering 1,066,480 $OM linked to bot activity, 29 members of the community have been allocated 106,648 $OM for providing high-quality and valid sybil reports.
- 26,942,144 OM will be set aside for burning.

However, their team's suspected Sybil wallets remain eligible for the airdrop. 

let's start with conversation with their team with me ,  [archive link

Guitarplayer, who personally knows one of the top-10 participants, mentioned to me: “If a user invests real money, they typically aren’t a Sybil.”


So, I decided to analyze whether the team was involved in the airdrop.


First, I examined the top wallet on the rich list, [mantra1nc3wrnq7swa0c66nf873g8y4p7q06ezqzyct22](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/account/mantra1nc3wrnq7swa0c66nf873g8y4p7q06ezqzyct22), 
which is currently holding 802,760,316 tokens —approximately 803 million —and has made 7 transactions.

Then, the wallet transferred 802,760,316 $OM to three different wallets. When we add the remaining balance to the amount sent, the total equals the entire supply of $OM, which is 888,888,888.

- sent 4 millions $OM to [mantra1j320pmjr4ms9j5emjewn79jn03yadrjklddy5l](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/account/mantra1j320pmjr4ms9j5emjewn79jn03yadrjklddy5l) ( Regarding the bridge wallets, if we initiate a bridge from Ethereum, the funds are provided by this wallet. ) 
- sent 21 millions $OM to [mantra1ernlrs32yldvxtewg5h3nq4rw7askq6s7k0p6q](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/account/mantra1ernlrs32yldvxtewg5h3nq4rw7askq6s7k0p6q) 
- sent 60 millions $OM to [mantra1k27scm9s3yvr3lthuf52nt7veg3uug4g35s40j](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/account/mantra1k27scm9s3yvr3lthuf52nt7veg3uug4g35s40j) ( Regarding the bridge wallets, if we initiate a bridge from Ethereum, the funds are provided by this wallet. ) 

The wallet [mantra1ernlrs32yldvxtewg5h3nq4rw7askq6s7k0p6q](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/account/mantra1ernlrs32yldvxtewg5h3nq4rw7askq6s7k0p6q) dispersed 21 million $OM by sending it to five different wallets.

On January 31, 2025, these five wallets collectively transferred a total of 331,254 $OM to the wallet [mantra1dft0ye8ceppzd70l39emqqam77tlwz8ahdeeve](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/account/mantra1dft0ye8ceppzd70l39emqqam77tlwz8ahdeeve) .

Subsequently, mantra1dft0ye8ceppzd70l39emqqam77tlwz8ahdeeve transferred all the funds to mantra16l5qsgzjueayxa2z78eee53lv3t0kfy3z68pqc, which appears to be the primary wallet of the Sybil farmer [(as referenced in the linked repository)](https://github.com/SolanaLeeky/SybilSlayingSeason/blob/main/sybil-farming/README.md).

Upon the mantra1ernlrs32yldvxtewg5h3nq4rw7askq6s7k0p6q, we found that its initial funding wallet was mantra1w0q87xm6jfjgn3u3vn4d3fj34g5tcz6v0xwnux .
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d8aa476-fff5-4bae-b1c2-1b8edd01f5e8)

[C8799E38B41E85CBBC90002DF95B8BD7ABE9B5AC064F3B8B1FEE844ED5EBDFCE](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/tx/C8799E38B41E85CBBC90002DF95B8BD7ABE9B5AC064F3B8B1FEE844ED5EBDFCE)
[E19AC456719EDDDEC32392CC70332CB3A7C057F45A3C1D8FC17C68E70A0873FE](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/tx/E19AC456719EDDDEC32392CC70332CB3A7C057F45A3C1D8FC17C68E70A0873FE)

In the wallet mantra1w0q87xm6jfjgn3u3vn4d3fj34g5tcz6v0xwnux, the memos on the first two transaction hashes are labeled **“Eco1”** and **“Ecosystem Delegation.”**

the next two transactions from this wallet transferred 300,088 $OM to the proposal creator wallet, [mantra1wdhs8cknyrxhy9ultvl98qqd77y8qeurtqaefw](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/account/mantra1wdhs8cknyrxhy9ultvl98qqd77y8qeurtqaefw) .

It belongs to the Mantra DAO proposal creator, associated with wallet [0xd4eeE3D50588D7dee8Dcc42635E50093E0AA8Cc0](https://snapshot.box/#/s:mantra-dao.eth/profile/0xd4eeE3D50588D7dee8Dcc42635E50093E0AA8Cc0/proposals)

On October 23, 2024, the proposal creator transferred 100 OM to wallet 0x9bb39ff907f45d85e76cad651f8d5a06cece5a96 (transaction hash: 0xb341877dd934a5ea2fb90ce4c97006b82efa5bcb2d8624ea1119f7af1ae1e615). That wallet subsequently deposited 100 OM to the Mantra mainnet (transaction hash: [0x214da4673492218e9c827ceb1765d662b46cec1a4500232a6058a6e7e33c3692](https://www.okx.com/web3/explorer/eth/tx/0x214da4673492218e9c827ceb1765d662b46cec1a4500232a6058a6e7e33c3692)).

By analyzing the input data as UTF-8, we discovered the address mantra1wdhs8cknyrxhy9ultvl98qqd77y8qeurtqaefw, indicating it is an alternate wallet for the proposal creator. Meanwhile, mantra1w0q87xm6jfjgn3u3vn4d3fj34g5tcz6v0xwnux appears to be another team wallet.

the wallet mantra1w0q87xm6jfjgn3u3vn4d3fj34g5tcz6v0xwnux transferred 27 million $OM to [mantra1zesxcwdh475kwma58sprzzyqxay5gnexjx7r5q](http://176.97.114.147:5173/MANTRA-1/account/mantra1zesxcwdh475kwma58sprzzyqxay5gnexjx7r5q) through six separate transactions.
